### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223240010
### AIM: 
To develop "Maze Runner" game in Unity integrating A* algorithm and depth search first backtracking algorithm. 
### Algorithm:
1. Create a new 2D Unity project.
2. Design the maze using a script that randomly generates walls and paths each time the game runs.
3. Use a grid layout to place wall and floor tiles (as sprites or prefabs).
4. Place the player, exit, and ghost in specific or random positions on the maze.
5. Write player movement so they can walk only on paths.
6. Implement the A algorithm* so the ghost can calculate the best path to the player.
7. Make the ghost follow the player along that path and update the path as the player moves.
8. Detect collision between ghost and player to trigger “Game Over.”
9. Detect when player reaches exit to trigger “You Win.”
10. Repeat: Each time you run the game, the maze is new, and the chase begins again.

### Program:
```
```
### Output:

### Result:
Thus the game was developed using Unity and adopted _-----------AI technology.
